# Backbone 26th December 2021

In this [2021-12-26 edition](https://hosted-datasets.gbif.org/datasets/backbone/2021-12-26/) of the GBIF Backbone 
we have updated various sources but kept configurations and the software as it was.

### Data source changes
The [Catalogue of Life (COL) Checklist version October 2021](https://doi.org/10.48580/d4t2) has been used as the basis and for most of the hierarchy.
The [WCVP Fabaceae](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/f7053f73-74fb-4c9f-ab63-de28c61140c2) source was updated to the latest edition.
As always [Plazi](https://www.gbif.org/publisher/7ce8aef0-9e92-11dc-8738-b8a03c50a862) has been adding many new publications 
containing new species descriptions.
